# Statement and Background

A high-level statement of the problem you intend to address, e.g. finding correspondences between neural recordings and DNN layers. Try to translate the high-level into specific questions if you can - but this may be difficult before you do exploratory data analysis.

Give background on the problem you are solving: why it is interesting, who is interested, what is known, some references about it, etc.

# Data Sources

The Data Source(s) You Intend to Use

Describe the data source(s) you will use. If you're not doing one of the recommended projects, make sure you have access to the data you want to use *in the quantity and quality you need*. Ideally you should get all the data in your hands before starting your project. Several teams in past offerings of this course have run into trouble because they couldnt obtain the volume or quality of data they needed. Many online data sources (e.g. Yelp) strongly throttle the data volume you can get through their API. Others (Twitter) have a higher limit but have use restrictions that you must respect. Certain types of meta-data (e.g. location, demographics) in social media sources are both sparse and unreliable.

Describe how you plan to obtain the data, or how you got it if you already have it.

Give a summary of the cleaning/joining of data that you expect to do up front.

# Goals of Analysis

List some goals of your analysis, ideally in the form of testable hypothesis, or via well-defined success metrics. These can be tentative, and you dont need to stick to them throughout your project. Again since you havent done any exploratory analysis yet, you might assume that the data has structure that it doesnt, and you might not have seen other interesting patterns in the data. But you should always approach the data with some expectations so that your efforts are focused.

# Description of Data Analysis Tools & Lectures Utilized 

Describe the tools you plan to use throughout the project. As you might expect, there will be several stages in the project. Those will include exploratory data analysis, modeling (using machine learning), and possibly a scale-up from a sample of data to the full dataset. This part can also be tentative, and we will give you feedback on your analysis plan as part of grading the assignment.

# Data Products Project Will Produce

Data products include results of statistical tests, performance analyses of learning algorithms, visualizations of the data or model parameters. Give a list of these relevant to your project.
